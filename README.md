# Analysis of Traffic Collision data

Analysis of public California traffic collision data from SWITRS, https://www.kaggle.com/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs. Out of personal interest, I wanted to analyse some data with a focus on motorcycles to answer some basic questions on motorcycle demography and accidents.

Questions:
- What is the ratio of male to female drivers? Answer: We see a 12 to 1 ratio of male to female drivers.
- Are there sex differences in the accident causation? Answer: In relativ terms, males are as likely as women to cause an accident and not be the accident victim.
- Are there sex differences in favorite brands? Answer: The ratio of male to female drivers is substantially lower for motorscooters (e.g., Vespa). For traditional motorcycle manufacturers, there are only minor differences.
- What are common weather conditions and environment variables that affect risk? Answer: **TODO TODO TODO**
