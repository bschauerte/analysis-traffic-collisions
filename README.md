# Analysis of Traffic Collision data

Analysis of public California traffic collision data from SWITRS, https://www.kaggle.com/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs. Out of personal interest, I wanted to analyse some data with a focus on motorcycles to answer some basic questions on motorcycle demography and accidents.

Questions:
- What is the ratio of male to female drivers?
- Are there sex differences in the accident causation?
- Are there sex differences in favorite brands?
- What are common weather conditions and environment variables that affect risk?

## Required Libraries and Tools

* iPython/Jupyter Notebook
* Seaborn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
